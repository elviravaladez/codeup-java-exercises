======JAVA METHODS=====

Q: What is a Java method?

    -Code that is grouped together that can be used over and over again.

    A Java method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
    Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.



Q: Why use additional methods rather than writing all Java code in a main method?

    -To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
    -A way to make code more modular
    -Simpler to debug



Q: What does it mean to ‘call’ or ‘invoke’ a method?

    -It causes the statements in a method to "run"

    -When we call a function, we call it with arguments (the actual values passed to the method). Arguments can be literal values, variables, or themselves expressions that will be evaluated to a value that is passed to the method.

    -Keep in mind that the data type of the arguments must be the same as the data type of the parameters that the method is defined with.



Q: What are six parts of a method definition as explained in the curriculum?

    -visibility
    -static/instance
    -return type
    -name of method
    -parameters
    -body



Q: In what ways do Java methods differ from JS functions?

    -syntax is different
    -methods in Java are tied to a class or an object vs. lone functions in JS
    -default values require multiple methods vs. syntax in a single function
    -parameter data type is fixed in Java vs. flexible in JS
    -method calls have to relate to a main method in Java vs. no main method in JS



Q: What is a method signature?

    method name + parameter list

    add(int x, int y) //<-- Method Signature

    //CODE:
    public void setMapReference(int xCoordinate, int yCoordinate) {
        //method code
    }


    THE METHOD SIGNATURE IN THE ABOVE EX. IS: setMapReference(int, int)



Q: What is method overloading?

    Being able to define methods with the same name but accept different parameters.

    With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters:
    int myMethod(int x)
    float myMethod(float x)
    double myMethod(double x, double y)





Q: Will changing the return type of a method overload it?


    No, you cannot overload a method based on different return type but same argument type and number in java.
    What is recursion and what are the differences/pros/cons compared to iteration?
    Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.
    Roughly speaking, recursion and iteration perform the same kinds of tasks:
    Solve a complicated task one piece at a time, and
    combine the results






Q: What is a StackOverflowError?
    A StackOverflowError is a runtime error in java. It is thrown when the amount of call stack memory allocated by JVM is exceeded. A common case of a StackOverflowError being thrown is when the call stack exceeds due to excessive deep or infinite recursion.
